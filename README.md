# CRUD BASIC WebApp - SumTech Labs Challenge

## Challenge

We have a little store where we need to keep track of the orders coming from the "sales area".
We can identify the following entities: User Product
This is what the owner of the little store wants:
As a System Administrator, I would like to create users.
As a System Administrator, I would like to create products.
As a System Administrator, I would like to be able to associate products with users.

Your task will be to analyze and implement a solution. We request Java Language (java project ) and store data in MySQL. Create APIs for all CRUD Entities which have to be consumed from a front-end application (react or angular). 
Note: for all backend use the spring framework.
